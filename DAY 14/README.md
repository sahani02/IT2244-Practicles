ðŸ”¹ Explanation:

- fork() creates a child process.
- Both parent and child execute the rest of the code.
- getpid() prints the PID of each process.
- fork() returns:
    * 0 to the child
    * PID of child to the parent

ðŸ”¹ Explanation:

- Two fork() calls create up to 4 processes:
- Each process executes both fork() calls independently.
- Output depends on order of execution.
- if-else conditions identify each process based on return value of fork().

ðŸ”¹ Explanation:

- First fork() creates a child.
- The parent then creates another child (sibling of the first child) using a second fork().
- This results in 3 processes:
    * Parent
    * Child
    * Sibling (another child of the parent)
- getppid() shows each processâ€™s parent PID.
